ZBG: Why not Zoidberg?
==============

Standalone files should use ASCII ```zbg0``` as magic numbers to start the file, then immediately begin with objects. Use of zbg encoding within other files need not be prepended, but may be if the file encapsulation requires it.

New manifest encoding: inspired by [BEncode](https://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification#Bencoding) and ASN.1 / X.690, but tailored for binary content and hash addressing. All big-endian, like everything else EIC, and byte-oriented.

Types supported:

+ 256- and 512-bit hashes
+ Lists
+ Dictionaries
+ Arbitrary octets

Nesting is fully-supported. List order is meaningful and preserved. Dictionaries must always be sorted ascendingly by the big-endian integer representation of their keys. Null objects are not supported, but empty objects are.

256-bit hashes (or arbitrary octets)
-----

+ Type flag: ASCII ```h```
+ No length declaration (32 bytes by definition)
+ value is raw octets (no cross encoding)
+ No terminator

512-bit hashes (or arbitrary octets)
-----

+ Type flag: ASCII ```H```
+ No length declaration (64 bytes by definition)
+ value is raw octets (no cross encoding)
+ No terminator

Lists
-----

+ Type flag: ASCII ```l```
+ No length declaration
+ Values are not delimited
+ Terminated with ASCII ```e```

Dictionaries
--------

+ Type flag: ASCII ```d```
+ No length declaration
+ Keys (must be hashes or octets) followed by value
+ Terminated with ASCII ```e```

Arbitrary octets
---------

+ Type flag: ASCII ```:```
+ Length declaration: First octet encodes the number of subsequent length octets. 11111111 shall not be used. Following octets describe value length in octets.
+ value in raw octets (no cross encoding)
+ No terminator

Examples
-------

Arbitrary octets: ASCII 'hello world' (length of 11)

```3A 01 0b 68 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f 72 6c 64 ```
